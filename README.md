# burger

After a long day I rpoudly present... my burger app.  The king of all apps that have to do with burgers.  The Burger King, if you will, though you probably won't and most likely shouldn't.

In this app you can do it all, you can write in a burger you want to eat, you can click that you ate that burger, and you can look at the list of burgers your gluttonous self devoured just moments prior.  Amazing.

It all started with a little database, it wanted to be known to the world, but it only held one even smaller table.  Burgers. it has an ID a Name, and DEVOURED! 

The id auto increments.  The names are supplied by you! I threw in a couple for fun though. And DEVOURED! is set to false.
Also, its not in database as DEVOURED! its just more fun to say that way.

once you have cloned this repository you can run npm install to get all those sweet dependecies I put in here.
Follow that up with running the Schema.sql and the seed.sql and you got a database going.
Next, node, do it.  Node server.js opens up listening on port 8080.

go there!

Localhost:8080

there you will see the beautiful burger page.  Start working on that wishlist, and then start working on eating those badboys. 
Enjoy.
